# Project-3

# Description

- Due to covid, many ice cream parlors are not allowing customers in their store. However we have created an online app where customers can place an order for pickup allowing them to enjoy a delicious treat of their choice. We can bring your your morning, mid-day or late night cravings to life. If you have already placed an order you can check your past order by looking for your name and your order will be displayed.

# Backend Description
- models/Schemas. (Alex, Joe)

- The Milkshakes Schema will contain keys with the value of flavor, toppings, size and price. The flavors, toppings and size values will be set to String and the value of price will be set to Number.
- The Ice Cream Schema will contain keys that hold values of flavor, toppings, size that will all be set to strings. In addition to those we will also throw in a price value set to a number.
- The Menu schema will hold a list of our menu items. The schema will contain values of flavor, toppings, holder and size, so that the frontend can pull that info and set up a menu in the app where users can see what options they have to choose from.
- We will create three seperate controllers. One will contain the Schema and model for the milkshakes, the other holds the Ice Cream Schema and model, and the menu will function with the menu schema and model.
